AM-AI Front-End (iPhone)
AM Solutions, LLC

An iPhone app that takes photos of car, boat, or home issues and uses artificial intelligence to diagnose the problem. The app will:

- Let users take photos with their iPhone camera
- Send those photos to your backend server (already built!)
- Show repair instructions, cost estimates, and product recommendations
- Display 3D models in augmented reality (AR) to help with repairs

This is just an iPhone interface.
